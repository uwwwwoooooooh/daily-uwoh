**Goal: To track, find, and secure my favorite Waifus across the internet.**

I need an automated hunter-seeker system that monitors artists and indexes everything instantly. If a new illustration drops, I want it found and cataloged before I even wake up.

* **`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`**: Web framework.
* **`gorm.io/gorm`**: ORM. It maps my complex obsession (Artists, Tags, Metadata) into **PostgreSQL** without me needing to write raw SQL.
* **`gorm.io/driver/postgres`**: Driver to talk to the DB.
* **`net/http` & `context`**
